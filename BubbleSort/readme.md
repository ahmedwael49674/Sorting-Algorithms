# Bubble-Sort 
## Idea
- Repeatedly pass through the array
- Swaps adjacent elements that are out of order 
- At each pass, the largest unsorted item will be pushed in its proper place. 
- Stop when no more exchanges were performed during the last pass.

 ## Disadvantage
- Easier to implement, but slower than Insertion sort
- this algorithm has complixty of O(n<sup>2</sup>) making it inefficient on large lists
