# Quick-Sort 
## Idea
- Creates two empty arrays to hold elements less than the pivot value and elements greater than the pivot value.

 ## Disadvantagel
- the algorithm takes O(n log n) comparisons to sort n items. In the worst case, it makes O(n<sup>2</sup>) comparisons, though this behavior is rare
