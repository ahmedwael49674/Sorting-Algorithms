#Selection-Sort 
##Idea
- Find the smallest element in the array
- Exchange it with the element in the first position
- Find the second smallest element and exchange it with the element in the second position Continue until the array is sorted
 ##Disadvantage:
- Running time depends only slightly on the amount of order in the file
