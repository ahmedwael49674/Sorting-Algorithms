# Selection-Sort 
## Idea
- Find the smallest element in the array
- Exchange it with the element in the first position
- Find the second smallest element and exchange it with the element in the second position Continue until the array is sorted
 ## Disadvantage
- Running time depends only slightly on the amount of order in the file
- this algorithm has complixty of O(n<sup>2</sup>) making it inefficient on large lists
